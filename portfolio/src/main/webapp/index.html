      <p>Hi, I'm Megan! I'm a rising junior at the Univers
          ity of Washington studying CS. 
          I like food (making AND eating) and love trying new recipes. In my free time, 
          I play tennis with my mom and playing video games. I'm looking forward to learning
          about software engineering and building projects. I also hope to build a PC this 
          summer so if you have any guidance let me know :^)</p>
