      <p>About Me!</p>
      <p>Hi, I'm Megan! I'm a rising junior at the University of Washington studying CS. 
        I like food (making AND eating) and love trying new recipes. In my free time, 
        I like playing tennis with my mom and video games with my friends. I'm looking forward to learning
        about software engineering and building projects. I also hope to build a PC this 
        summer so if you have any guidance let me know :^)</p>
      <p>
      <p>I also have two cats named Buzz and Ozzy!</p>
