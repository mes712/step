      <p>About Me!</p>
      <p>Hi, I'm Megan! I'm a rising junior at the University of Washington studying CS. 
         I like food (making AND eating) and love trying new recipes. In my free time, 
          I like playing tennis with my mom and video games with my friends. I'm looking forward to learning
          about software engineering and building projects. I also hope to build a PC this 
          summer so if you have any guidance let me know :^)</p>
